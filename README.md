# compost

Comparisons to Observations of Simulated Tracers (compost) does what it sounds
like. It is a collection of utilities to compare transport simulations of
atmospheric trace gases to in situ and satellite data.

Compost is written in Matlab and (please forgive me) C shell. I'll be
converting the C shell stuff to Python, but the Matlab code will likely persist
for some time. Directions, and any needed updates, for running on Octave
instead of Matlab are forthcoming.

# compost

Comparisons to Observations of Simulated Tracers (compost) does what it sounds
like. It is a collection of utilities to compare 3D fields of atmospheric
constituents, most commonly from a GCM/CTM/DAS, to in situ and satellite data.

Compost is written in Matlab and (please forgive me) C shell. The C shell
script will be converted to bash or Python eventually. The Matlab code will
likely persist for some time. Directions, and any needed updates, for running
on [GNU Octave](https://octave.org), a free Matlab replacement, are
forthcoming.
